# Breakout_Game
Breakout! is a hit arcade game from the 1980's. I created this using Python Turtle, which uses the TkInter Graphical User Inerface. While limited graphically, it does provide enough for each item in the game to be it's own object. This allows simplicity in the code meaning it is easier to read and debug. 

TO DO:
Move brick contruction to Brick class.
Fix bug where ball gets trapped in the paddle and bounces around inside of it before shooting out
Make ball bounce correlate to where it hits the paddle.
